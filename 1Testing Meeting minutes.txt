Minutes of meeting with Musoplan product manager
==============================================================

Project - Musoplan
Date - 6 Sept 2021


Discussion - The product manager needs Musoplan to be tested for requirements. Some salient points discussed were:

We will need to assess the software on 3 fronts:
1) Manual Unit testing of functions
2) Automated Unit testing of functions
3) Systems manual testing for data flow 

The user will use the Command line for manual testing.
The user will use Jest for automated testing of the code
All documentation and tests will be made available to the user using a test directory in the Musoplan repository
